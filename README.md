# Memory MPC for manipulation purpose

ros-noetic is necessary to launch the HPP scripts.

HPP prerequisites: 
```pyver=$YourPythonVersion #(>=3.8)
apt-get install robotpkg-py${pyver}-hpp-manipulation-corba
apt-get install robotpkg-py${pyver}-qt5-hpp-gepetto-viewer
apt-get install robotpkg-py${pyver}-qt5-hpp-gui
apt-get install robotpkg-py${pyver}-hpp-environments
```

To load the Talos robot, table, boxes, and contact surfaces, you need to install the following repositories:
```
git clone --recursive -b devel https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/talos-data.git
git clone --recursive -b devel https://gitlab.laas.fr/gepetto/gerard-bauzil.git
git clone --recursive -b devel https://github.com/agimus/agimus-demos.git
```

# HPP_dataset

hpp_dataset folder contains HPP scripts used to generate collision-free trajectories given a target to reach. 
To run the scripts, open 3 terminals. In the first one, launch the corba-server:
```
hpp-manipulation-server
```

In the second one, launch Gepetto viewer:
```
gepetto-gui
```

In the third one, launch any python script. `script_lean.py` generates a contact motion with the table in full body. 
`generate_reduced_wp.py` generates a dataset of waypoints for a reaching motion with torso + right arm, given an obstacle to avoid. Target to reach and initial pose are sampled uniformly.

# pfc_script

Example of boos-minions architecture to generate HPP trajectories on the LAAS computation platform. It uses apptainer as a container.

The script `neural_network.py` takes as argument the dataset generated by HPP scripts and trains a neural network to output a collision-free state trajectory given target to reach + initial robot configuration.

# learn_dataset

The script `neural_network.py` takes as argument the dataset generated by HPP scripts and trains a neural network to output a collision-free state trajectory given target to reach + initial robot configuration.

# Test neural network

The script `reduced_ocp.py` generates a Crocoddyl optimal control problem with reduced Talos model (torso + arm) and solves it using a neural network warm-start. It displays the trajectory using pybullet. 
The problem configuration is stored in `configuration_reduced.py`.
The problem formulation is performed in `work.py`.
The bullet simulation code is handled in `bullet_Talos.py`.
